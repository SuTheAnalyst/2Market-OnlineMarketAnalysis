# 2Market-OnlineMarketAnalysis
Exploratory analysis and presenting insights
Context of the business
2Market is a global supermarket which sells products online and in-store. The goal of this prject is to help them understand their customer purchase behaviour. 

In particular, 2Market wants to understand:
- The demographics of their customers 
- Which advertising channels seem to be the most effective
- Which products seem to sell the best and if that varies based on demographic

# Analytical approach
1. I familiarised with the project context and requirements, created a problem statement, and identify questions I would like to ask to help better understand the project as well as questions I would like to try and answer by analysing the data.
2. I then used Excel to analysed the data to identify initial insights.
3. Next, I imported the data into Tableau dashboard to communicate initial insights I have identified.
4. Following this, with the use of SQL, I imported the data sets into the Postgres database and queried the data to identify insights and areas to explore further.
5. Ultimately, based on the result of the analysis, I adjusted the dashboard I created.
